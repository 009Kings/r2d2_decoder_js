# So Hey...

Hopefully you're just here to check your answers, but if not, please let someone on your instructional team know. If you got completely lost we really need to know about it so we can give you some extra help and get you back on track. It is not any trouble to us to arrange extra help. In fact, it's literally our job! So don't be shy to reach out if you're struggling!

The consequences of not getting help when you need it can really stack up. Learning is like a step on a ladder or a staircase. It doesn't take too many missing steps before you have an overwhelming gap to cross. Let us know you need extra tutoring preferrably before you get to that point!

### Working Backward

Take a look at the `answers.js` file and try to work backward and understand what was originally being asked of you.

Hopefully it makes sense after that. Maybe we just explained the problem badly? But if this assignment still doesn't make sense after seeing the solution, please inform your instructional team ASAP!

We're here to help!
